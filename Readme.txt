Description: Cryptographic Project

This is a cryptographic project that implements the XOR logic to encrypt texts.

The interface of the program is very simple and intuitive, therefore nobody will have problems with this.

The only change that the user should make is to edit the lines 221, 222, 415 and 416 with an email account and their respective password (gmail), because the program has an optional function of sending the encrypted or decrypted texts to your email.

Thanks for supporting !! I'm able to receive improve tips !! Enjoy it !!
